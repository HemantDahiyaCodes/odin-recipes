    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Here's a basic recipe to make oatmeal:</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup rolled oats (not instant oats)</li>
      <li>2 cups water or milk (or a combination of both)</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt (optional)</li>
      <li>
        Optional toppings: honey, maple syrup, fresh or dried fruits, nuts,
        seeds, cinnamon, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Boil the Liquid:</strong>In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water or
        milk (or a combination) to a boil over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Oats and Salt:</strong>Once the liquid is boiling, stir in 1
        cup of rolled oats and a pinch of salt (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Oats:</strong>Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain
        a gentle simmer.
        Cook the oats uncovered for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the cooking time depending on how thick or thin you prefer your oatmeal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stir Occasionally:</strong>Stir the oats occasionally to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pan and to ensure even cooking.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check Consistency:</strong>After about 5 minutes, the oatmeal should have absorbed most of the liquid and become creamy. If you prefer a thicker consistency, cook for a few minutes longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong>Once the oatmeal reaches your desired consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat.
        Let it sit for a minute or two to cool slightly and thicken further.
      </li>
    </ol>
