    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Here's a basic recipe to make plain steamed rice:</p>

    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup long-grain white rice (such as basmati or jasmine)</li>
      <li>2 cups water (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the Rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse it under
        cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch
        and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine Rice and Water: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice
        and 2 cups of water. You can add a pinch of salt if desired, though this
        is optional.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a Boil: Place the saucepan over high heat and bring the water
        to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>Simmer: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Let the rice simmer gently for about 15-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Avoid stirring the rice during this time to prevent it from becoming sticky.</li>
      <li>
        Let it Rest: After cooking, remove the saucepan from the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for about 5 minutes. This allows the steam to redistribute throughout the rice and makes it fluffier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fluff and Serve: After resting, uncover the saucepan and use a fork to fluff the rice gently. Serve hot as a side dish or as a base for other dishes.
      </li>
    </ol>
